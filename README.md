# Automatic-Image-Caption-Generation

Caption generation is a challenging artificial intelligence problem where a textual description must be generated for a given photograph.

It requires both methods from computer vision to understand the content of the image and a language model from the field of natural language processing to turn the understanding of the image into words in the right order. Recently, deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art results on examples of this problem.

### **Acknowledgement**

I would like to thank **Jason Brownlee** for his wonderful [blog](https://machinelearningmastery.com/develop-a-deep-learning-caption-generation-model-in-python/) that help me to learn how to build a `Image Caption Generator`.
